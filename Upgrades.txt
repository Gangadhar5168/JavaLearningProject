What’s Next?
Here are some ideas to enhance your project:

🔐 1. Password Encryption
Store hashed passwords instead of plain text using MessageDigest (e.g., SHA-256).

🧪 2. Add Unit Tests
Use JUnit to test login, registration, and grade-related functionality.

📝 3. Input Validation
Prevent blank names or roles.

Check that grades are valid (A/B/C...).

Prevent duplicate users on registration.

📂 4. Organize Files Better
Store student records in a students/ folder as separate files (optional enhancement).

🧑‍🏫 5. Teacher Grade Updates
Allow teachers to update existing grades for students.

💾 6. File Backup
Make a backup copy of gradesFile.txt before writing (safety mechanism).
